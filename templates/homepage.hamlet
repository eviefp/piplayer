                    <ul .list-group>

                        <li .list-group-item>
                            This page was generated by the <tt>#{handlerName}</tt> handler in
                            <tt>Handler/Home.hs</tt>.

                        <li .list-group-item>
                            The <tt>#{handlerName}</tt> handler is set to generate your
                            site's home screen in Routes file
                            <tt>config/routes

                        <li .list-group-item>
                            The HTML you are seeing now is actually composed by a number of <em>widgets</em>, #
                            most of them are brought together by the <tt>defaultLayout</tt> function which #
                            is defined in the <tt>Foundation.hs</tt> module, and used by <tt>#{handlerName}</tt>. #
                            All the files for templates and wigdets are in <tt>templates</tt>.

                        <li .list-group-item>
                            A Widget's Html, Css and Javascript are separated in three files with the
                            <tt>.hamlet</tt>, <tt>.lucius</tt> and <tt>.julius</tt> extensions.

                        <li .list-group-item ##{aDomId}>
                            If you had javascript enabled then you wouldn't be seeing this.
